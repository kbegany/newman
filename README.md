newman
======

newman with integrated cost


Preliminary Analysis 1:
- grab pre-computed correlation matrix textfiles

Preliminary Analysis 2:

- grab all ROI time series for each subject
-- remove cerebelum and vermis
- calculate and save partial correlations for each subject


Primary Analysis (for both 1 and 2):
- for each subject compute newman partitioning across almost-full cost range
